K-Means algorithm is a well-known algorithm for clustering data. In order to use this
algorithm, we need to assume that the number of clusters is known beforehand. We then
segment data into K subgroups using various data attributes. We start by fixing the number
of clusters and classify our data based on that. The central idea here is that we need to
update the locations of these K centroids with each iteration. We continue iterating until we
have placed the centroids at their optimal locations.
